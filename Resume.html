            <h4><li>Dep-Free for you</li></h4>
            <P>This is my personal project.The main aim of this project is to help those people who are getting emotionally 
                unstable. i n todays world life is too busy and no one has time for no one. So I'm working over this project
                where people can share there stories and feelings by keeping their identity anonymous. This will help to
                reduce anger, depression among people. By clicking over the link the page will direct to a space where
                people can share there feelings and submit it. There is a posts section where the write ups of people will
                be shared keeping the identity anonymous and other people or my team could give suggestions or some 
                sympathy to that post in the comment section. </P>
            <h4><li>Web-dev vehicle project</li></h4>
            <P>With the help of this project we will be able to create a platform where people could compare the prices of
                various transport communication available for the particular destination with variation in prices according
                to the means of transport chosen. In this project we are also providing features like women security
                alarm, ambulance emergency, car rental features in our platform for easy convinence of the user.
                Emergency helpline is the best feature of the app. In short our project include almost every  aspect
